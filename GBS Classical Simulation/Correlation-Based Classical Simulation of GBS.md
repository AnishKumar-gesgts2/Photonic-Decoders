# Evaluating and Improving Correlation-Based Classical Simulations of Gaussian Boson Sampling in Quantum Photonics

**Status (October 2, 2026):** first small-system selective-correction benchmark completed. The method, 144-case suite, held-out results, and publication assessment are in [[First Research Draft]]. Jiuzhang 2.0 is the eventual threshold-click target, but calibrated experimental benchmarking and a scalable sampler remain uncompleted. This note preserves the original research rationale and preliminary evidence. See [[Quantum Research]].

**Revised after skepticism audit:** The numerical result was independently confirmed, but the current implementation failed the stronger practical comparison: an optimized exact calculation achieved essentially zero error and was cheaper in most tested cases. [[Skeptical Audit and Stronger Benchmarks]] is the current assessment. Continue only as an information diagnostic or after redesigning the fitting/sampling architecture; do not treat the first draft's error reduction as a scalable algorithmic advance.

For a fuller explanation with technical and plain-language sections, see [[GBS Classical Simulation Project Description]].

## The idea in plain language

A Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiment sends specially prepared light through a network and records a pattern of detector clicks. A classical computer can predict the complete pattern distribution for small experiments, but exact calculation becomes expensive as the number of modes and clicks grows. Some faster classical programs therefore reproduce selected features, such as how often pairs or small groups of detectors click together.

The question is whether those limited features can make a program **look accurate on accessible checks** while it still gets consequential parts of the full pattern distribution wrong. The first research stage is to measure that mismatch on small, physically valid GBS systems where the exact answer is available. A possible second stage is to spend computation only on the higher-order information that matters most, then test whether this improves accuracy at a practical cost. Neither a mismatch on a toy model nor a promising proposal establishes that a large quantum experiment has been classically simulated.

## The computational mechanism

An output with $M$ threshold detectors is a binary string $x\in\{0,1\}^M$: $x_i=1$ means detector $i$ clicked. Its full probability distribution $P(x)$ has up to $2^M$ entries. A low-order method instead computes moments such as $\mathbb E[x_i]$, $\mathbb E[x_ix_j]$, and perhaps selected products involving three or more detectors. Calculating or storing all $k$-detector subsets requires $\binom{M}{k}$ values before accounting for the work per subset.

The exact Gaussian optical state is specified compactly by its covariance matrix, but that **does not mean** the detector click distribution is determined by a small list of click correlations. Photon interference and conditioning can create correlations involving many outputs. Matching a finite collection of low-order moments also does not, by itself, prove a small full-distribution total variation distance:

$$\operatorname{TVD}(P,Q)=\frac12\sum_x |P(x)-Q(x)|.$$

For a concrete intuition, two ordinary binary distributions can match every correlation below some order while differing in a global parity feature. That logical example shows why the inference needs testing; it is **not** evidence that a particular physical GBS experiment has this problem. The empirical question is how large the mismatch is for physically generated GBS distributions, measured noise, and specific published samplers.

There is a second distinction: beating an experiment on a chosen correlation score is a claim about that score. Showing accurate, affordable classical sampling of the experiment's complete task is a stronger claim. The project should report both without substituting one for the other.

| [Quesada, Arrazola, and Killoran, *Gaussian Boson Sampling using threshold detectors*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01639) | Gives the Torontonian formulation and exact small-system threshold-click probabilities. | Supplies a reference distribution for controlled tests, not a scalable solution to the largest experiments. |

The paper acknowledges its algorithm-specific boundary. |
| [Dodd et al., *A fast and frugal Gaussian Boson Sampling emulator*](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14923) | Uses a chain-rule sampler informed by cumulants through a selected order, with fifth-order results at 144 modes. | The authors describe the chosen order as heuristic and discuss higher brightness and thousands of modes as challenges. A different representation could change scaling. |
| [Jiuzhang 4.0 experimental paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.09092) | Reports a much larger GBS experiment and compares its data with several classical mockups using click counts, correlations, subsystem Bayesian scores, and an MPS cost estimate. | The paper already rejects a simple low-order greedy sampler on higher-order correlations. A new proposal must address those tests and must not infer full-system behavior solely from subsystem trends. |
| [Goodman et al., *Gaussian boson sampling: Benchmarking quantum advantage*](https://arxiv.org/html/2604.12330) | Proposes a recent phase-space-based approximate classical sampler and reports comparisons at large scale. | It is a serious competing baseline for any later claim of better classical simulation; its projected detector samples and corrections must be evaluated on the same task and metrics. |

The common research opportunity is **not** that these papers overlooked the existence of truncation or that one published result is already disproved. It is to map accuracy versus computational cost across different approximations, find a specific failure regime if one exists, and test a targeted remedy.

## Preliminary work already done

Nine eight-mode *physical GBS* click distributions were calculated exactly in a preliminary local prototype. A maximum-entropy surrogate was fitted to match every click moment through order $k$. The mean full-distribution TVD over those nine instances was $0.142$ for $k=2$, $0.085$ for $k=3$, and $0.026$ for $k=5$; all nine fits converged. This establishes only that matching these finite sets of moments did not make **that surrogate** exact on those small instances. It is **not** a test of Dodd et al.'s sampler, experimental data, or a large-scale quantum-advantage claim. The code and recorded outputs are preserved in this folder as `work/gbs_low_order_information_probe.py`, its helper `work/gbs_projection_probe.py`, and `outputs/gbs_low_order_information_probe.json`. The scripts require Python with NumPy and SciPy.

A separate arithmetic check found that storing *every* cumulant through order five as a dense explicit array would require at least about 1.22 exabytes at 8,176 modes if each entry occupied four bytes. This is a lower bound for that particular representation, not for compressed, selective, on-demand, or different classical algorithms. The calculation and recorded output are `work/gbs_cumulant_scaling_probe.py` and `outputs/gbs_cumulant_scaling_probe.json` in this folder.

A synthetic fixed-click example also showed that a subsystem Bayesian score can rise across tested subsystem sizes while its full-system score has the opposite sign. It is an information-theoretic counterexample, **not** a calibrated GBS model or evidence that Jiuzhang 4.0's actual score reverses. The calculation and recorded output are `work/jiuzhang_subsystem_bayes_counterexample.py` and `outputs/jiuzhang_subsystem_bayes_counterexample.json` in this folder.

## Proposed research question and test

**Question:** For small GBS instances where the exact click distribution is available, when do low-order validation scores stop predicting full-distribution accuracy, and can a selective correction improve the accuracy-cost tradeoff of a classical sampler?

1. **Build the reference cases.** Generate reproducible threshold-detector GBS instances with varied mode count, squeezing/brightness, and loss. Use an exact Torontonian calculation at sizes where it is tractable. Validate normalization and one- and two-mode marginals. Treat any larger instance without exact probabilities as a separate validation regime.
2. **Choose named baselines.** Start with simple independent and pairwise maximum-entropy samplers, then reproduce a published algorithm only if its implementation and resource requirements allow a faithful comparison. Label simplified surrogates as such; do not attach their errors to a different published method.
3. **Measure what the scores miss.** On identical held-out instances and samples, report full TVD where exact calculation is possible, click-count distribution error, correlations by order, and the relevant published-style validation scores. Identify cases where sampler rankings disagree. Conditioned-on-click-count and unconditional comparisons should be kept distinct.
4. **Test one targeted improvement.** Candidate: use a fixed budget to compute selected higher-order detector subsets chosen from information available *before* held-out evaluation, then correct a low-order sampler's conditional probabilities. This is a hypothesis, not an existing result. Compare it with simply raising the uniform truncation order, with matched memory, time, and sample counts.
5. **Check scaling and failure cases.** Record preprocessing, memory, and sampling time as modes and brightness grow. Keep every predeclared test case, including those where the correction fails. Do not extrapolate a small-size timing curve into a large-scale advantage result without evidence that accuracy stays adequate.

**A meaningful positive result** would be a reproducible improvement over a named baseline in full TVD on held-out exact instances at comparable cost, followed by survival of stronger validation tests at larger sizes. **A meaningful negative result** would identify when selective corrections fail or become too expensive. Either outcome can make a sound science-fair study. A claim that a specific experiment's quantum advantage is weakened would require a competitive large-scale classical sampler on the experiment's actual task and data.

## Scope for the immediate proposal

The science-fair proposal can commit to the small-system accuracy-versus-cost study and present the selective correction as the method to investigate. It should not promise a paper, a scalable classical breakthrough, or a reversal of an existing quantum-advantage claim. A publishable result would require a clear new method or robust finding beyond the known fact that low-order statistics are incomplete. BlueQubit Track 2 becomes a direct fit only if the work produces a credible classical competitor to an experimental advantage baseline; the benchmark study is the foundation for that possibility.

## Completed first study and remaining decisions

The completed first study used 36 development and 108 held-out synthetic 6-, 8-, and 10-mode GBS instances. Selected triple corrections reduced mean full TVD from 0.10575 for pairwise fitting to 0.06641, compared with 0.08157 for budget-matched random selection and 0.05269 for all-triple fitting. Selection retained 74.1% of the aggregate uniform-triple improvement, with approximately 60% of the uniform method's preprocessing time and 70% of its traced allocation peak by median within-instance ratios. Every residual-selected held-out fit passed the declared numerical gate. The full study retains the printed TAP approximation's unsupported cases and three abnormal optimizer terminations in other models.

The algorithm fits an exactly normalized exponential-family distribution and samples its enumerated table. This is a completed bounded benchmark, not a scalable simulation breakthrough. Full results, computing-cost audit, metric-ranking reversals, all predeclared cells, and reproduction instructions are linked from [[First Research Draft]]. The original proposals above describe the broader program; remaining decisions are:

- Which practical architecture can fit and sample selected correlations without full outcome enumeration?
- Does the frozen rule transfer to new circuit structures, larger sizes, and richer noise models?
- Can it beat a faithful strong published baseline at matched accuracy and measured computing cost?
- Does the final contribution support an algorithm paper or a substantive benchmarking/validation paper after a completed novelty audit?
